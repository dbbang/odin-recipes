    <h3>Acorn jelly is a delicious Korean dish that is usually eaten as a side dish.</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup acorn starch</li>
            <li>3 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp perilla oil or sesame oil (If possible, I recommend using perilla oil, as it enhances the flavor
                of dotorimuk significantly.)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <li>In a medium-sized pot, combine the acorn starch with water. Stir continuously while cooking over medium
                heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                As the mixture begins to thicken (it takes about 3 minutes for induction and 4 minutes 30 seconds for a
                gas stove), add the salt. Reduce the heat to low and continue stirring for 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Incorporate the perilla oil (or sesame oil) and cook for an additional 10 minutes over low heat,
                continuing to stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the acorn jelly into a container and let it cool at room temperature for 1 hour. After cooling,
                cover with the lid and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before using.
            </li>
        </ol>
